I used ChatGPT during this assignment as a coding assistant. The AI helped me with clarifying how to structure the pyproject.toml file and how to make my package installable with pip install .. Additionally, I used the AI to understand how to create and edit the myst.yml file and set up the MyST website structure, table of contents, and Binder link. I also received guidance for writing the Makefile targets (env, html, clean). All final code was reviewed and tested by me, and I made modifications to ensure correctness and compatibility with my repository.
